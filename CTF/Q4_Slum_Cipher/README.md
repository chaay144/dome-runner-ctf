# Slum Cipher (Easy)

## You have
- `slum_poster.txt` → one line of encoded text.

## Your task
1) The text is encoded with the **Vigenère cipher**.
2) The **key** is the resistance name: `HOLLOW`.
3) Decode letters only (keep spaces and numbers).
4) Convert spaces to underscores `_` and wrap as `flag{...}`.
   Correct flag: `flag{OLD_METRO_TUNNEL_B3}`

## Hints
- Try any online Vigenère decoder.
