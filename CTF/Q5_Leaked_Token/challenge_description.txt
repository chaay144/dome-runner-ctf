Title: The Dome Runner — Leaked Token (Medium/Hard)

Description

to this repository and then removed it. The Dome didn’t see it,
but can you?

flag{LEAKED_GIT_TOKEN_9F3A}

Hint
Browse the commit history for this folder or use:
git log --follow -- CTF/Q5_Leaked_Token
git show <commit>:CTF/Q5_Leaked_Token/access_token.txt
